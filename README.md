# tic-tac-toe-v1
This is going to be my first command-line interface game, based in the game Tic-tac-toe.
This is started as a small project cuz I was bored and decided to make the Tic-tac-toe game based on the CLI, I was hoping to get warmed up since I haven't coded for more than a week and I hope that I can gain more knowledge about it since I may have burnt out xD
